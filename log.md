### Day 4: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Worked on a Codewars problem - [Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-encryption-number-1-alternating-split)
2. Participated in a few [clash of code](https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode) in [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/)

**Details:** 

1. Codewars - Thought if there is a way to construct th String in *O(m)* (m = string length). But ended up with a *O(mn)* solution. On checking others' solution, seems *O(mn)* is the way to go.
2. The clash of code has three modes (chosen at random)
    - Fastest - Complete the puzzle as fast as possible.
    - Shortest - Write the lowest code size
    - Reverse - Guess what to do by observing the provided set of tests.
